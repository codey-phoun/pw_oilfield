## Project Introduction

Produced water (PW) is water produced as a byproduct created during the extraction of oil and natural gases. The water quality of PW ranges from well to well, but most PW contains oils, heavy metals, and traces of naturally occurring radioactive material. PW can serve as an alternative water source if the pollutants found in the water are removed. Bioremediation by algae is one potential method for the treatment of  PW. Alternatively, the PW may potentially be used as a growth medium for algae cultivation in biofuel production. 

*Phaeodactylum tricornutum* is a model marine diatom with a fully sequenced genome. This diatom was previously observed by Dr. Jeroen Gillard to have increased photosynthetic capacity when grown in pure PW compared to a normal medium. An RNA sequencing project was conducted by his lab to investigate the differential gene expression of *Phaeodactylum tricornutum* grown under three different growth medium conditions and different growth phases. In this study, we processed the RNA sequencing data and explored which Phaeodactylum tricornutum genes were differentially expressed under the different growth mediums and growth phases.
