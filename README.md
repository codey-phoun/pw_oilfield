## Project Introduction

Produced water (PW) is water produced as a byproduct during the extraction of oil and natural gases. The water quality of PW ranges from well to well, but most PW contains oils, heavy metals, and traces of naturally occurring radioactive material. PW can serve as an alternative water source if the pollutants found in the water are removed. For now, PW can be used in algae cultivation for biofuel production. In this study, we aim to examine the exponential growth and physiology of the diatom *Phaeodactylum tricornutum* under three types of conditions: no treatment (control), 10% PW, and 100% PW. Also, we will examine the stationary growth phase under no treatment and high treatment PW.
